# Cl-Smt - Common Interface to SMT (Satisfiable Module Theories) solvers from Common Lisp

This library provides an interface to State-of-the-Art SMT solvers,
such as the entrants of [SMT-COMP](http://smtcomp.sourceforge.net/2017/).

Fortunately the input to SMT solvers are already S-expression.

Specification of SMT solver input is described in http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/ .

Examples are [here](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/examples.shtml).

List of solvers [here](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/solvers.shtml).

## Usage


## Dependencies
This library is at least tested on implementation listed below:

+ SBCL 1.4.0 on X86-64 Linux 4.10.0-38-generic (author's environment)

Also, it depends on the following libraries:

+ trivia :
    
+ alexandria by *Nikodemus Siivola <nikodemus@sb-studio.net>, and others.* :
    Alexandria is a collection of portable public domain utilities.
+ iterate by ** :
    Jonathan Amsterdam's iterator/gatherer/accumulator facility
